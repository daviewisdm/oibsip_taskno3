# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover insights into the factors that influence wine quality and build accurate predictive models.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and visualization of the wine quality dataset to understand key patterns and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification and analysis of outliers in the dataset to improve model performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Use of Seaborn, Matplotlib, and WordCloud for comprehensive data visualization and feature analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries. Install the required libraries using:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn wordcloud
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daviewisdm/OIBSIP.git
cd OIBSIP/wineQuality
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the dataset, visualize data, and build predictive models.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the chemical properties of wine, we can predict its quality with reasonable accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the field of viticulture.
